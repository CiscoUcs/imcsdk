def snmp_multiple_config_with_configcommit_for_hp_and_above(handle, mos):
    '''
    In any of the cimc version, if any of the snmp configuration is modified,
    by default snmp engine commit for each and every change in config.
    Each commit takes 60-90 seconds approximately.
    Hence in case of sending back to back request to modify snmp config,
    next request always fails as the commit is in progress for first request.
    Second request will go through only after the commit is complete for first
    request.

    This behaviour is very time consuming if you want to configure all 15
    snmpuser and snmptrap.
    To reduce the time and number of request, we chose to use 'configConfMos'.
    However in case of snmpuser and snmptrap, even you send multiple config in
    a single request using configConfMos, at end point they are traversed
    sequentially. Hence no reduction in time.

    To fix this, in HP(4.0) release, a parameter 'config_change' is introduced
    which lets user control when to commit the snmp configuration change.
    If this parameter is not part of request, by default the commit happen with
    every modify request.

    This function will add the functionality to use this new parameter
    'config_change' if the version of cimc is HP and above.
